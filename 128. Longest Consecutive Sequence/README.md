## <span style="color:red">128. Longest Consecutive Sequence</span> 👉

- Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest  consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

1. Example
```
1.
  Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

2.
  Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
  Output: 9
```
